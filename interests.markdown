This page details a few other interests I have, and a little bit more about them.

# Competitive Smash Bros

I play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, a fighting game including characters from various different video games, at a competitive level. I regularly attend events across Scotland and the UK, including online and offline (Covid permitting!). I find the hobby very fulfilling, since there's a continuous cycle of training and improvement over time. I'm also the "Smash Overseer" at the Glasgow University Esports Society (GUES). This role involves letting people know about upcoming events for the game (such as tournaments) within the society, along with encouraging people to try the game at various events such as Fresher's Week.

# Board Games

I regularly play different modern boardgames, both physically and in a digital form - the tacticility of physical games really appeals to me, and boardgames are "transparent" about their rules in a way that most videogames aren't. Some of my current favourites include:

* The Mind: A very simple game where players have numbered cards from 1 to 100, and they need to put down the cards in their hands in ascending order... without any sort of communication. I have no idea how this works, but somehow it does.
* King/Queendomino: An elegant pair of board games, where players place domino tiles containing various types of terrain to try and create the best kingdom within a 5x5 square. Kingdomino is simpler and slightly more elegant, but Queendomino includes several interesting mechanics such as placing buildings.
* Gloomhaven: One of the most ambitious boardgames ever, Gloomhaven is essentially a boardgame version of Dungeons and Dragons, with really interesting combat mechanics rewarding patience, prior planning and teamwork.
* Suburbia: A game where you place tiles to form the ideal neighbourhood, balancing various needs such as residential areas, commerce and industry. It's one of those great games that initially seems quite simple, but becomes deceptively deep over time.

# Reading

I also read quite a bit when I have the time, mainly non-fiction. Some things I've read recently include:

* Sid Meier's Memoir!: A Life in Computer Games, by Sid Meier - an autobiography by Sid Meier, designer of some of the most influental strategy and simulation games of all time, most notably the Civiliization series. I didn't know much about his pre-Civ work, so this has been an especially interesting read so far.
* Spelunky, by Derek Yu - part of the Boss Fight Books series of various games, this is the standout of the bunch. Derek Yu, developer of Spelunky, discusses a lot of different aspects of game design, and in particular he's not afraid to include technical details without scaring the reader away. He also discusses the game's journey from a freeware PC game to an HD sequel on many major platforms. An essential read for fans of Spelunky, roguelikes, or games in general!
* Letters to a Young Mathematician by Ian Stewart - the book is presented as a series of letters to a fictional mathematician called Meg, as she progresses from highschool, though university, and all the way to becoming a maths lecturer. The book provides a wealth of great advice for people of all ages (but especially young people) considering a career in mathematics, including the role of computation in mathematics, how mathematics should be taught, and how to tell a story using mathematics. When I'm feeling demotivated or down about my work, a chapter or two from here normally does the trick.

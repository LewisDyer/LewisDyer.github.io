This page details a few ways you can get in touch with me.

# University Email

My university email account is 2299195D (at) student (dot) gla (dot) ac (dot) uk. This is the best place to contact me if it's related to academic work.

I also have a staff email account at Lewis (dot) Dyer (at) glasgow (dot) ac (dot) uk, but I don't check this as often so stick to the student email in most cases.

# Personal Email

For more general queries, my personal email account is lewisd251 (at) gmail (dot) com.

# LinkedIn

My LinkedIn profile is available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewis-dyer-4b9991185/). I don't use it especially often, but if we've worked on something together feel free to send me a request and I'll add you as a connection.

This page details various roles and responsibilities I've held so far, including jobs and other voluntary positions.

# Undergraduate Demonstrator
## School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow
#### September 2020 - Present

As a lab demonstrator, I lead small groups of 6-8 second year computing science students to support their understanding of lab work and various concepts in Computing Science courses. There's a lot of flexibility in how we run labs, so a big part of my role is tailoring lab organisation to various groups of students, keeping students engaged and coming up with various ways to present course material.

I'm also a demonstrator representative for one of my courses - this involves regular meetings with more senior tutors and lecturers discussing issues that students are facing in labs.

Courses covered include:
* Networks and Operating Systems Essentials 2
* Algorithmic Foundations 2 (discrete mathematics for computer science)

# Intern Developer
## Barclays
#### July 2020 - August 2020

As a software development intern, I worked on a project with multiple other interns and a wider team of developers and analysts, developing a proof of concept for cloud-to-cloud communication between Amazon Web Services and Salesforce. This involved developing a strong understanding of AWS in a short time period, particularly AWS CloudFormation for specifying system architecture and automating deployment.

# Treasurer
## Pause Gaming
#### October 2020 - Present

As the treasurer of Pause Gaming, Glasgow University's foremost casual gaming society, I'm responsible for managing the society's money, tracking expenditure and deciding whether or not proposed purchases are financially viable. I'm also involved in wider committee work, including shifting our events online due to COVID-19.

Hello! My name's Lewis, and I'm a 4th year student working towards an integrated masters in Computing Science and Mathematics at the University of Glasgow. I'm especially interested in the areas where mathematics and computing science intersect, such as model checking and graph theory. The site's currently a work in progress, but there's roughly what I'm planning to include once things are up and running:

* Current experience: Describing various jobs and roles I've held at various points.

* Projects: Some more details on some projects I've worked on.

* Hobbies and Interests: a bit more about what I get up to outside of work/university.

* Some more contact details
